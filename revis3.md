## Databases

Database knowledge is important for Full Stack Developers. The role of a Full Stack Developer might involve designing and maintaining databases. Here are some topics that you should be familiar with:

These all might seem overwhelming. Don't worry, you don't need to know everything. You can learn these topics over time. You can also learn these topics on the job. The most important thing is to be curious and willing to learn.

To help me revise for a Full Stack Developer role, I created a list of questions that I can use to test my knowledge and eventually built a small web app to help me revise. Maybe you will find it useful too.
