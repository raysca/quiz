Full stack developers should excel in at least one server programming language, typically Node.js. Key areas of expertise include:

- Express (or other web frameworks)
- REST APIs
- Node.JS event loop
- Async programming (e.g. callbacks, promises, async/await)
- Streams
- WebSockets
- REST APIs
- GraphQL

### Example Node.js Questions

Why is the following code not a good practice in error handling?

```js

- What is the purpose of a Content Security Policy?

## DevOps

Efficient deployment and maintenance are integral skills. Focus on the following:

- Docker
- CI/CD
- AWS (or other cloud providers like Azure or GCP)
- Observability (e.g. logging, monitoring, tracing)
- Infrastructure as Code (e.g. Terraform)

### Example DevOps Questions
- What is the relationship between Docker and Kubernetes?
- Why is application observability important?
- What are the common stages in a CI/CD pipeline?
  
## General Engineering Practices

Adopting standard engineering practices is key. Ensure familiarity with:

- Testing (e.g. unit testing, integration testing, end-to-end testing)
- Git (e.g. branching, merging, rebasing, squashing)
- Agile (e.g. Scrum, Kanban)
- Refactoring
- Code Review

### Example General Engineering Questions

- What is the difference between unit testing and integration testing?
- What is the difference between rebasing and merging?


## Databases

Database knowledge is foundational. Key areas of understanding include:

- SQL (e.g. joins, aggregations, indexes)
- NoSQL (e.g. key-value stores, document stores, graph databases)
- ACID
- Transactions
- Database Indexing

### Example Database Questions

- What is the purpose of a database index?
- What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`?

Remember, this list is a starting point. Tailor your preparation to align with the specific needs of the company you are applying to.
